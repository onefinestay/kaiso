Version 0.13.0
--------------

Add `Manager.has_code_defined_attribute` to determine whether an attribute was
defined on a type in code.

Minor: Removed unnecessary `Manager.is_registered_type` and
`Manager.get_registered_types` methods.


Version 0.12.0
--------------

Add `Manager.change_instance_type` to change the type of existing instances.

Minor: Start reorganising the test suite to have more smaller test modules.


Version 0.11.0
--------------

`Manager.query` (and `Manager._execute`) now return generators of results
instead of being generators themselves. This way, calling `query` triggers
the execution, rather than requiring e.g. `next(manager.query(...), None)`.

Minor: Also fixed the connection tests so they no longer need to be first.


Version 0.10.0
--------------

Explicit type creation: Types are no longer lazily created when instance.save
is called. If the type isn't already persisted, `TypeNotPersistedError` will be
raised.

This enables more aggressive caching of the type registry.
